# monolith.nvim

A sister-project of [despair.nvim](https://github.com/al1-ce/despair.nvim).

The original personal nvim distro. Many plugins (there were much more before, see old commits or [old readme](OLD-README.md)).

This distro will still kind of be here but it won't be the main one since I found it nice to have it more minimal with my other personal distro [despair.nvim](https://github.com/al1-ce/despair.nvim).

## Dependencies

Idk anymore, can be easily checked with `:DepsMissing` command or with `:checkhealth`.

A single solid requirement without which everything breaks is `lua-language-server`.

## Structure

See [despair.nvim](https://github.com/al1-ce/despair.nvim)'s readme.

## Notice

#### This distro is not supposed or intended to be perfect out of the box experience. It is preconfigured to be vanilla-like friendly experience, but for your personal needs changing configs will be required.
#### If this doesn't suit you then please look at [other NeoVim distributions](#other-neovim-distributions)
